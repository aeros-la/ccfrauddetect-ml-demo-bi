# Explores allow you to join together different views (database tables) based on the
# relationships between fields. By joining a view into an Explore, you make those
# fields available to users for data analysis.
# Explores should be purpose-built for specific use cases.

# To see the Explore youâ€™re building, navigate to the Explore menu and select an Explore under "Ccfrauddetect-ml-demo"

# To create more sophisticated Explores that involve multiple views, you can use the join parameter.
# Typically, join parameters require that you define the join type, join relationship, and a sql_on clause.
# Each joined view also needs to define a primary key.
